		-a file name youpi.bad_extension in nop

Setup the configuration file as follow:
- / must answer to GET request ONLY
- /put_test/* must answer to PUT request and save files to a directory of your choice
- any file with .bla as extension must answer to POST request by calling the cgi_test executable
- /post_body must answer anything to POST request with a maxBody of 100
